				<h2>Week 2 Activities</h2>

					<ol>
						<li><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you‚Äôve got potential? Do you believe it? Why, why
							not?</strong><br>
							<p>I‚Äôve been told throughout my life that I‚Äôm full of potential, however it was often stated as
							‚Äúwasted potential‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt totally believe it but in a way I could feel it. Likely because of the way I grew up I just didn‚Äôt believe people from my background could live up to those expectations‚Ä¶ I thought the examples of that we‚Äôre Cinderella stories told to people to make them feel nice.</p></li>
						<li><strong>Internal or External factors keeping you from reaching your goal? How can you over come them?</strong>
							<p>Internal- lack of confidence, anxiety, procrastination.<br>
							External- <span class="strike">Lack of opportunity, lack of positive influence.</span></p>
						</li>
						<li><strong>How do you create value for others?</strong>
						<p>I am willing to go far above and beyond for the sake of a well executed project.</p></li>

				<h2>Week Zero Reflection</h2>
				<p> This week has been primarily been about adjusting to a new workspace and routine. While I felt this week went fairly smoothly I suspect that the coming weeks are going to be rough. The calm before the storm so to speak. Nonetheless I‚Äôm excited to get deeper into this whole thing. Onward.

			<div class="reflection weekOne">
				<h2>Week One Reflection</h2>
				<p>This is the week where the other foot began to drop. While week0 was more of a welcome review, week1
					is where the topics of discussion in class began to eclipse my understand of web dev. queue my sense
					of being lost. While at times I start to confuse and over complicate things I'm also excited to add
					to my skillset.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="reflection weekTwo">
				<h2>Week Two Reflection</h2>
				<p>As anticipated the other shoe did indeed drop this week. In retrospect this week seems like three
					rolled into one. The subject matter continues to get more and more foreign as the pace seems to gain
					momentum almost hourly. None of this is to say that I am unhappy with any of that; on the contrary I
					prefer work environments that operate this way. It keeps me engaged. <br>
					Its somewhat masochistic I suppose. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
