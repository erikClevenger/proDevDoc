				<h2>Week Zero Reflection</h2>
				<p> This week has been primarily been about adjusting to a new workspace and routine. While I felt this week went fairly smoothly I suspect that the coming weeks are going to be rough. The calm before the storm so to speak. Nonetheless Iâ€™m excited to get deeper into this whole thing. Onward.

				<h2>Week One Reflection</h2>
				<p>This is the week where the other foot began to drop. While week0 was more of a welcome review, week1
					is where the topics of discussion in class began to eclipse my understand of web dev. queue my sense
					of being lost. While at times I start to confuse and over complicate things I'm also excited to add
					to my skillset.</p>
